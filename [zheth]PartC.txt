Linear-Conflict Heuristic
    This is an extenstion of the Manhattan Distance Heursitic.
    Let's say we have 3 tiles, X Y G, all in the same line (row or column).
    The goal state position for X is where G currently is.
    Since Y is in the way of tile X, there must be at least an additional 2 moves to get X to G.
    The heuristic is calculated for all numbered tiles, and then added to the regular Manhattan Distance Heuristic.
    This gives a number closer to the actual cost, but is still an underestimate, which means it is admissable.

Performance Comparison
    Manhattan Distance
      This heuristic is able to solve the same puzzles in less time than the default heuristic.
      It evaluated about 1/5 the number of nodes than the default heuristic did, in the hard example.
      It is more informed than the default heuristic because it gives a more accurate lower bound on the number of moves it will take to solve the puzzle.
      The default heuristic only gives how many tiles are out of place, and says nothing about how many moves it might take to reach the goal state
    Linear-Conflict
      It significantly reduced the amount of time it took to solve the 8-puzzles.
      When solving the hard puzzle, it evaluated about 1/2 the number of nodes compared to the Manhattan Distance,
      and 1/9 of the number of nodes compared to the default heuristic. It is the fastest of the 3.
      This makes sense because it is simply an improved version of the Manhattan Distance Heurisitc
    For all 3 of my heuristics, testing an impossible puzzle resulted in a stack overflow.
    With a depth of 20, the openlist grows far to huge to evaluate everything.
